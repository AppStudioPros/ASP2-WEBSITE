<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's primary goal is to prepare the application for deployment to Vercel, integrate Sanity.io for content management, and use Resend for email services. This required a significant backend overhaul to remove the existing MongoDB dependency and build new FastAPI endpoints for a contact form and newsletter subscription. Additionally, the user requested a series of major UI/UX and animation enhancements to add a WOW factor to the site, inspired by examples they provided. This includes a complete redesign of the hero section with complex animations, increasing the logo size, converting the blog to a Coming Soon page, and adding animated effects to UI cards. The most recent requests focused on implementing a highly detailed animated light trail effect, standardizing the card design across the site, and building a complex rotating services showcase.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Backend Refactor**: Replace MongoDB with a new backend structure ready for Sanity.io and Resend.
- **API Endpoints**: Create, test, and integrate frontend components with new endpoints for a contact form and a newsletter subscription.
- **Deployment**: Assist the user in configuring their Vercel project to deploy the React frontend.
- **Animation Overhaul**:
    - Implement a complex, real-time code and build animation mockup in the hero section.
    - Add ambient background effects like a blueprint grid and floating particles.
    - Implement an animated orange light trail that travels between the corner brackets on UI cards, with very specific visual requirements (thin, tapering, no glow, clockwise movement, coordinated).
- **UI/UX Updates**:
    - Significantly increase the main logo's size.
    - Convert the blog page into a styled Coming Soon placeholder.
    - Standardize all key component cards across the site to use a sharp-cornered HUD style with orange brackets and large, faded background icons.
    - Implement a rotating Services Showcase with unique, complex animations for each of the 5 services.
    - Update the Our Latest Works portfolio section with real project images.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a multi-page React app with a FastAPI backend. The backend is stable with integrated Resend APIs for the contact and newsletter forms. The frontend has been heavily modified with numerous WOW factor animations and UI enhancements. The corner bracket light animation is now working and implemented across the site on all designated cards. A new, complex Services Showcase component has been built with auto-rotating, animated visuals for each service. The portfolio section has been updated with real project images provided by the user.

**Last working item**: 
    - Last item agent was working: The agent updated the Our Latest Works portfolio section with six new project images as requested by the user. The  component was modified to include the new image URLs, titles, and tags.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? The next agent should use the screenshot tool to capture the Our Latest Works section on the homepage and present it to the user for final confirmation.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - There are no known pending bugs or issues. The last set of issues related to the Services Showcase component were resolved.

**In progress Task List**:
  - There are no tasks currently in progress.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P1: Animation Enhancements - Phase 2**: Implement the next set of approved animations, including interactive cursor effects, form field animations, and number count-ups (some number animations were implemented, but a full pass may be needed).
    - **P2: Animation Enhancements - Phase 3**: Implement the final polish animations, such as 3D flips for tech stack icons.

    Future Tasks:
    - **Sanity.io Content Implementation**: Define schemas in Sanity and build out the dynamic frontend pages (Blog, Services, etc.) to fetch content, replacing the static and Coming Soon pages.
    - **Enable AI Website Scanner**: A backlog item requiring an .
    - **Portfolio Case Studies**: Develop full case study pages for the items in the Our Latest Works section.
    - **Finalize Budget Calculator**: A low-priority issue from a previous session that is pending final user feedback.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Feature/Animation Implementation**:
  - Implemented a complex, auto-rotating **Services Showcase** component with unique animated visuals for 5 different services ().
  - Successfully implemented and refined the **Corner Bracket Light Animation** based on iterative user feedback. The final version is a thin, orange, tapering line that moves along card borders ().
  - Updated the Our Latest Works portfolio section with 6 new user-provided images ().
- **UI/UX Standardization**:
  - Applied the **Orange Bracket Card** style (sharp corners, HUDFrame, clipped background icons) to multiple sections across the site:
    - About Page ( section)
    - Services Page ( section)
    - Blog Page ( card)
    - Contact Page (Contact form)
  - Refactored  cards to have large, faded, and clipped background icons, with sharp corners.
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - Resolved a critical bug in the  component that caused a runtime error () and prevented the animation loop from restarting.
  - Fixed multiple visual glitches in the  animations, including duplicate messages in the AI chat and a broken look in the Cloud Solutions visual.
  - Debugged and fixed a series of cascading issues that prevented the corner bracket light animation from rendering, including  on parent containers, incorrect component structure, and JS syntax errors.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
   - **Budget Calculator**: This was a pending item from the initial handoff. The user has since prioritized other major features, so this remains a low-priority backlog item.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
  - None.

**Code Architecture**

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is highly visual and provides very specific, iterative feedback. **Always use screenshots** to confirm UI changes before asking the user for verification.
- Your first action should be to confirm with the user that the updated Our Latest Works portfolio section is correct.
- The  component, used for the orange bracket cards, is still located inside . Be aware of this when making any changes to card styles.
- The  component is new and contains complex, multi-layered animations with  and . Edits require careful testing to avoid re-introducing timing or state-related bugs.
