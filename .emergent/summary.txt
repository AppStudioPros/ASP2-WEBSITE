<analysis>**original_problem_statement**: The user's goal is to create a visually impressive, WOW factor website with complex animations and prepare it for deployment. Initially, this involved a backend refactor to remove MongoDB, integrate Resend/Sanity.io, and add various UI/animation enhancements.

In the current session, the user's requests have been highly iterative and focused on major frontend animation changes:
- **Hero Section Overhaul**: Multiple, complete redesigns of the main hero animation, evolving from a coding a website concept to a sophisticated, vertical-layout animation featuring a mock AI chatbot app on a phone with a live-typed code editor below.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations**: A large-scale implementation of various animations that trigger as the user scrolls, including:
    - 3D rotating cards for key sections.
    - Animated number counters that start from zero.
    - A heatmap with sequentially appearing dots.
    - Animated strikethroughs on text.
    - Pulsing glow effects.
- **Portfolio Feature Implementation**: The latest and largest request is to build out a complete portfolio section. This involves creating a main landing page for all projects and individual detail pages for over 20 projects, based on HTML/ZIP files provided by the user.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application is a feature-rich React frontend with a stable FastAPI backend. The frontend is heavily animated with Framer Motion, featuring a complex hero animation, an auto-rotating services showcase, and numerous scroll-triggered effects. Many components have been updated in this session with new animations like 3D card rotations, number counters, and animated strikethroughs. The agent was in the middle of implementing a major portfolio feature, having successfully processed 22 user-provided project archives and created a central data file () to power the new pages.

**Last working item**: 
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing a full-featured portfolio section. After encountering and resolving issues with extracting user-provided ZIP files (by installing the  package), the agent analyzed the content, determined they were templates, and created a structured data file at  to house all the project information. The agent was just about to create the All Projects landing page.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent. This is a large feature involving multiple new pages, dynamic routing, and data mapping. The testing agent should be used to verify all pages render correctly, links work, and the layout is consistent.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - There are no known pending bugs or issues.

**In progress Task List**:
  - **Task 1: Complete Portfolio Feature Implementation (P0)**
     - **Where to resume**: The data file  is complete. The next step is to create the All Projects page component (). Following that, implement a dynamic route (e.g., ) for individual project detail pages, update  with the new routes, and link to the All Projects page from the main navigation and the homepage .
     - **What will be achieved with this?**: A complete, multi-page portfolio section with a main gallery and 22 individual project detail pages, fully integrated into the existing website.
     - **Status**: IN PROGRESS
     - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
     - **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - **P1: Refactor  Component**: Extract the  component from  into its own file for better code organization.

    - **Enable AI Website Scanner**: A backlog item requiring an .
    - **Portfolio Case Studies**: Flesh out the individual project pages with rich content (the current task creates the structure, but the source files were templates).
    - **Finalize Budget Calculator**: Low-priority backlog item.

**Completed work in this session**
- **Hero Animation Overhaul**:
  - Iteratively redesigned the hero animation multiple times, settling on a vertical layout with an animated mock AI chatbot app and a code editor below.
  - Fixed chat visibility and flickering issues.
  - Replaced the background with a user-provided AI robot image, styled to fit the section.

  - **Mission Section**: Removed icons and added count-up animations for stats.
  - **Truth Bomb Section**: Added animated red strikethroughs and a pulsing glow effect.
- **Component Fixes**:

**All files of reference**
- **Created**:
  - : Stores metadata for 22 portfolio projects, acting as a mock database.
  - : A new reusable component for cards with a 3D rotation effect on scroll.
- **Updated**:
  - : Extensively rewritten to implement a complex, multi-stage hero animation.
  - : Updated the hero section to use a new background image.
  -  & : Updated to use the new  effect.
  - , , , , : All updated to implement specific scroll-triggered animations and UI changes requested by the user.
  - , : Updated to remove rotating background icons.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- **The immediate and highest priority is to complete the portfolio feature.** The data is prepared in . You need to build the , a dynamic project detail page (e.g., ), and set up the necessary routing in .
- The user's HTML/ZIP files for the portfolio were content-less Webflow templates. You will need to create a generic but stylish project detail page template that uses the data from  (title, tags, image, etc.) and add placeholder content for descriptions.
- The user is highly detailed and specific about animations and visual styling. Expect iterative feedback and use screenshots to confirm changes.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
  - None.
