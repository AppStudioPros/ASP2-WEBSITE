**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The application has been successfully transformed from a single-page application (SPA) into a multi-page application (MPA) using React Router. It now features a shared layout and five distinct pages: Home, About, Services, Blog, and Contact. A significant number of UI/UX enhancements have been implemented across the entire site, including a reusable  for section headers, consistent card styling with faded background icons, and a coherent color and animation theme. The homepage layout has been rearranged, and numerous content updates and bug fixes have been applied, including fixes for page navigation, element spacing, and a crashing error on the contact page.

**Last working item**: 
    - Last item agent was working: Fixing the  component. The user initially reported that the slider value and the displayed investment amount were out of sync. The agent implemented a fix that makes the slider snap to one of five predefined values (, , , , ), ensuring the displayed number always matches the slider's position.
    - Status: USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    - Agent Testing Done: Y
    - Which testing method agent to use? Frontend testing agent to interact with the slider at all 5 discrete positions and verify that the displayed dollar amount and budget tier description update correctly for each step.
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Budget Calculator Synchronization (Priority: P0)
  - Issue 2: Update Footer Phone Number (Priority: P1)
  
  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - **Description**: In the first user message of the session, the user stated, the numbers on the top still do not match the numbers on the slider. will work on this later. While the agent implemented a snapping fix that the user accepted for now, the underlying dissatisfaction with the component may still exist. This is a recurring issue from a previous session.
     - Attempted fixes: The agent modified the component to use discrete, non-linear steps, forcing the slider to snap to one of five values. This ensures the displayed value matches the slider's current step.
     - Next debug checklist:
        1. Ask the user for final confirmation on the current snapping implementation.
        2. If they are still unsatisfied, ask for specific desired behavior (e.g., should the slider be continuous with a live-updating number, or should the labels be positioned differently?).
        3. Re-examine  to implement the desired logic.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This is a core interactive component on the homepage and a recurring source of user feedback. A definitive fix will improve user experience and resolve a lingering task.
