**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent's final task was to get the extracted website up and running for the user to preview. This involved copying the files to the correct directory, installing all dependencies, starting the services, and verifying that the site was accessible. The agent provided a summary and screenshots to the user. The user then responded to a series of prompts related to version control, accepting the incoming changes.
